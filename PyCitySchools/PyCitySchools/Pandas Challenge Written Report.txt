Pandas Challenge Written Report

•	Summarize the analysis and draw two conclusions from calculations:

Looking at the results of the analysis, the highest performing schools by percentages with passing scores were mostly charter schools, while all schools at the bottom for those percentages were district type. There was not necessarily a correlation/causation of higher passing percentages based on school budget and spending since the school with the highest budget didn’t have a high overall passing percentage. While there was one charter school that was in the large size school category, overall charter schools were mostly medium to small size, whereas all the district schools were large. The small and medium category schools had much higher overall passing grade percentages compared to the large school category. It could be concluded that budget/spending has less of a positive effect on passing grade percentages rather than the size of the school. This can be seen when looking at the highest top five performing schools based on overall passing percentages, with all of them being charter, and the bottom five being all district type. The charter schools overall have smaller school budgets than the district schools, but this evened out due to school size since the budget per student was similar with both types of schools. This leads the user of the analysis to conclude that the positive effect of higher passing grade percentages may be due to smaller school sizes rather than school spending.
